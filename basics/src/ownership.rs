Ownership Rules
   Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
   There can only be one owner at a time.
   When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    String literal and String deal with memory differnetly and allow for String to be mutable
    This is because string literal get hardcoded into the binary.
    */

    When a variable is out of scope the memory is already called to be "dropped"
    and will become available again. This allows rust to quickly deal with memory.
    Best of both worlds!
    No real need to deal with every bit of memory
    Ability to control memory if required
